# Gestion_de_automoviles

This is a PHP program that, in conjunction with XAMPP, performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database for automobile management.

## Setup Instructions

1. Activate XAMPP by clicking on the "Start" checkboxes for Apache and MySQL:

2. Open your web browser and navigate to localhost to access your database:

![database](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/833c4808-879b-4e0d-90e5-e66559b58300)

3. Place your project in the `htdocs` folder inside the XAMPP installation directory:
